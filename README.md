# Enron-Email-Visualizer
Email Network Graph generator (Enron) - Utilizes Fusion Tables

This was created for Dr. K's Software Engineering Practicum.
It uses Python to analyze the enron Email dataset from a folder, it searches each file in that folder for a From and To.
It takes that data, saves it to a .csv and then that data is uploaded to Fusion Tables (manually) to generate a network Graph.

A simple application has already been compiled for the whole Enron Dataset (in App folder) for Windows PC's.
